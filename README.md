# React Draggable Bottom Sheet Component

## Introduction
Build a React application that features a bottom sheet with multiple screen snap points and incorporates spring motion animations.

## Approach and Challenges:
Implementing a draggable bottom sheet in React involves structuring the component with a drag handle and content area, using React state to manage position, handling mouse events to update position based on Y-coordinates, and applying CSS transitions for smooth animation. Existing CSS classes should be integrated for styling.
Challenges in creating a draggable bottom sheet include precise calculation of sheet position during user drag actions, seamless integration of existing CSS styles, ensuring responsiveness across various screen sizes, addressing cross-browser compatibility issues, and maintaining accessibility for all users.
